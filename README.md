## Architecture and Technology
### MVC Architecture
The application is built following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to separate processing logic, data, and user interface:

- Model : Manages data and interacts with Firebase
- View : User interface (Activities, Fragments, Layouts)
- Controller : Handles business logic and connects Model with View
### Technologies Used
- Language : Java
- Database : Firebase Realtime Database
- Authentication : Firebase Authentication
- User Interface : Material Design Components
- Navigation : Navigation Component
- State Management : SharedPreferences
## Technical Highlights
### 1. Flexible Data Model
The application uses HashMap data structures to manage shopping cart and wishlist, allowing quick data retrieval and updates with O(1) complexity.

### 2. Asynchronous Processing
Uses callbacks to handle asynchronous operations such as loading data from Firebase, ensuring the user interface remains responsive and unblocked.

### 3. Flexible Navigation
Uses Android Jetpack's Navigation Component to manage navigation between screens, providing a smooth and consistent user experience.

### 4. Login State Management
Stores login information using SharedPreferences to support automatic login feature, enhancing user experience.

### 5. Secure Transaction Processing
Implements order processing and payment mechanisms with security checks, ensuring data integrity.
